OpenSenseMap-API
================
This is the back-end for [OpenSenseMap](http://opensensemap.org).

OpenSenseMap is part of the [SenseBox](http//sensebox.de) project.
To get more information about OpenSenseBox and SenseBox visit the before mentioned links or have a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTOWYa42_rI).

The API has been built as part of my bachelor thesis at the ifgi (Institute for Geoinformatics, WWU MÃ¼nster).

### Technologies

* [node.js]
* [MongoDB]

### Install dependencies (Ubuntu)

It is assumed that you have installed node.js (developed using 0.10.26)

Install MongoDB according to [the manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) and create the database "OSeM-api".

The database schema will be created automatically upon data insertion and looks like this:
```
Database "OSeM-api"
  - Collections
    - boxes
    - measurements
    - sensors
```

### Run for Development & Production

Open the configuration file ```config/index.js``` and change settings accordingly.

|Variable name             | Explanation|
|--------------------------|---------------|
|```exports.targetFolder```|The folder where a generated Arduino sketch for each box will be saved upon registration|
|```exports.imageFolder``` |The folder where banner images for boxes are stored, should be in your htdocs (make sure read and write permissions are correct)|
|```exports.dbuser```      |MongoDB database user, leave empty if not configured|
|```exports.dbuserpass```  |MongoDB database password, leave empty if not configured|

After that, run the following command to install dependencies:

```npm install```

Then start the API process, press CTRL+C to stop:

```
node app.js
```

**or with Docker**
- install docker and docker-compose
- run `docker-compose up`

### Create the JSDoc pages

To create the documentation you need [apidocjs](http://apidocjs.com/) and run:
```
apidoc -e node_modules/
```

To push a new Version to gh-pages run:
```
git subtree push --prefix doc/ origin gh-pages
```
